# can create an archive containing files an postgres dumps

# in the example below an archive some_name containing 
# /etc
# /var/www
# /home/rob
# and the result of a postgres database dump 'some_db' 
# are created delivered on the local filessystem in /some_path with a filename:
# some_name_daily_<date>.tgz (every day)
# some_name_monthly_<date>.tgz (on the last friday of a month)
# some_name_yearly_<date>.tgz (on the first sunday of the year)
# 
# it keeps 5 yearly backups, 12 monthly backups and 31 daily backups
